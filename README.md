                                                     Safe Skies: Predictive Analytics for Reducing Aviation Crashes

What if we could predict the next aviation incident before it happens? In an industry where safety is paramount, even a small improvement in predicting crash risks can save lives. This project delves into historical aviation data to uncover patterns and build predictive models that forecast the likelihood of future crashes. By analyzing key factors such as flight phase, aircraft type, and operator history, our approach provides actionable insights that can transform how aviation authorities and airlines manage safety. 
The goal is not just to analyze the past, but to proactively prevent future tragedies, making air travel safer for everyone.


Project Overview

While modern aircraft are equipped with cutting-edge technology, accidents still occur due to a range of factors, from mechanical failures to human errors. By systematically analyzing data from past aviation incidents, we can uncover patterns, assess risk factors, and ultimately provide insights to make flying even safer. This project focuses on a comprehensive analysis of aircraft crashes, leveraging data science to identify trends, contributing factors, and high-risk scenarios to improve the overall safety and reliability of aviation.
